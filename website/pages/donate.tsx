            Keeping Whatcha Bringin alive and evolving is a one-human labor of
            love — it’s just me over here, building features, squashing bugs,
            and keeping the servers humming. There’s no team, no investors, no
            mysterious benefactors… just a guy with too many ideas and a very
            real hosting bill. If the app has made your life a little easier,
            smoother, or more delightful, tossing a coffee my way truly helps
            keep the lights on (and keeps me caffeinated enough to ship the next
            update).
